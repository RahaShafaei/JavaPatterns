# Design patterns implemented in Java

## Introduction
In this collection, I tried to solve examples of the types of categories defined for design patterns and practiced in this field.

For the code of each of the patterns, I got ideas from the __[On Java 8](https://leanpub.com/onjava8)__ book of __[Bruce Eckel](https://leanpub.com/u/BruceEckel)__ the author of __*Thinking in Java*__ and [
java-design-patterns](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns), and then implemented these ideas based on what I learned.

Based on the existing definitions, we have three general categories for design patterns, which I tried to do some examples of each category as an exercise, and these examples are given in the following three links:

* [Creational](https://github.com/RahaShafaei/JavaPatterns/tree/master/src/patterns/Creational)
    * [Abstract Factories](https://github.com/RahaShafaei/JavaPatterns/tree/master/src/patterns/Creational/abstractFactories)
    * [Builder](https://github.com/RahaShafaei/JavaPatterns/tree/master/src/patterns/Creational/builder)
    * [Dynamic Factory](https://github.com/RahaShafaei/JavaPatterns/tree/master/src/patterns/Creational/dynamicFactory)
    * [Factory Method](https://github.com/RahaShafaei/JavaPatterns/tree/master/src/patterns/Creational/factoryMethod)
    * [Multiple Dispatching](https://github.com/RahaShafaei/JavaPatterns/tree/master/src/patterns/Creational/multipleDispatching)
    * [Observer](https://github.com/RahaShafaei/JavaPatterns/tree/master/src/patterns/Creational/observer)
    * [Polymorphic Factories](https://github.com/RahaShafaei/JavaPatterns/tree/master/src/patterns/Creational/polymorphicFactories)
